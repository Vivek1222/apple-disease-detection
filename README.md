# Apple Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Description

This project uses deep learning to detect and classify diseases in apple crops, aiming to support farmers in early identification and timely treatment. By accurately diagnosing diseases in apple trees, this tool can help reduce crop loss, enhance yield, and improve agricultural productivity. The project leverages image recognition techniques to identify common diseases in apple crops, facilitating informed and efficient crop management.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a robust model for detecting and classifying apple diseases based on leaf images. Key goals include:

## Early Disease Detection: Identifying diseases in initial stages to minimize crop damage.

## Yield Optimization: Assisting farmers in applying targeted treatments, thereby enhancing yield.

## Resource Efficiency: Reducing the use of pesticides and other resources by diagnosing specific issues.

## Dataset

A labeled dataset of apple leaf images was used, featuring:

## Image Data: High-resolution images of apple leaves affected by various diseases.

## Disease Labels: Classification labels identifying each image as healthy or afflicted by a specific disease (e.g., apple scab, black rot).

## Methodology

The project was developed using Python, utilizing key deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The process involved:

## Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:

Applied transformations, including rotation, scaling, and flipping, to increase dataset diversity.
Ensured that the model can generalize well across different image conditions.

## Model Selection:

A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was chosen to handle image data.
Designed to balance complexity and performance, suitable for real-time detection if implemented on mobile devices.

## Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained the CNN model using training and validation datasets, achieving high accuracy in disease classification.
Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, confirming the modelâ€™s reliability in identifying diseases.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimized parameters through Grid Search, achieving fine-tuning for improved accuracy and minimized overfitting.

Key Findings

## Disease Identification: The model effectively distinguishes between healthy and diseased leaves.

## Scalability: Demonstrates the potential for application in large-scale farming for real-time disease detection.

## Resource Efficiency: Can reduce pesticide use by providing targeted treatment recommendations.
