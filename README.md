In the agricultural sector, the early detection and management of plant diseases are vital for ensuring crop health and maximizing yield. Traditional methods of disease detection often rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these challenges, our project focuses on leveraging the power of deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automate the detection of diseases in apple trees.
